# VanillaPlusPlusGenerator

Vanilla++ custom addon generator for GalacticScale 2.0 "Dyson Sphere Program" mod.

- Allows for 16-96 stars in the cluster.
- Allows for custom ratios of star types.
- Allows a degree of customization for number of planets that can spawn around stars.
- Planets will have their themes appropriate for their location, thus planets closer to the star will be hotter and those further away - colder.
- Allows for slight randomization of planet sizes; size of home planet can be explicitly set.
- Allows for moons to be smaller than their parent planets.

And more.
